2015 marked [The Processing Foundation](http://processing.org)'s fifth year participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).  Following is a summary of the 15 projects, in alphabetical order by project name, completed this summer by a terrific group of students.


### 1) [p5.js Windows Port](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor) by [Guy de Bree](https://github.com/Bruehausu), mentored by [Sam Lavigne](https://github.com/antiboredom)

For my Google Sumer of Code I developed a Windows port for the p5.js IDE, and fixed bugs for said editor. Itâ€™s now on the p5.js website! While it still has bugs, you can try it out on [the downloads page](http://p5js.org/download/). ([source code](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor))
