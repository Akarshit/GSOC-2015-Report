title: Google Summer of Code 2015
---

2015 marked [The Processing Foundation](http://processing.org)'s fifth year participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).  Following is a summary of the 15 projects, in alphabetical order by project name, completed this summer by a terrific group of students.


### 1) [p5.js Windows Port](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor) by [Guy de Bree](https://github.com/Bruehausu), mentored by [Sam Lavigne](https://github.com/antiboredom)

For my Google Sumer of Code I developed a Windows port for the p5.js IDE, and fixed bugs for said editor. It’s now on the p5.js website! While it still has bugs, you can try it out on [the downloads page](http://p5js.org/download/). ([source code](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor))

### 2) New Kinect libraries [openKinect](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing) and [KinectPV2] (https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2) by [Thomas Sanchez Lengeling](http://codigogenerativo.com/), mentored by [Elie Zananiri](http://dpt.co/)

The goal of the project was to expand and update the existing Kinect libraries; OpenKinect-for-Processing and KinectPV2. The openKinect library now supports the new Kinect v2 for Mac and Windows and Kinect v1 for Windows and Linux. For the KinectPV2, functionalities include: skeleton tracking, face detection, process frame raw data, point cloud extraction and contour extraction.

### 3) [Processing.py 3.0 Update](https://github.com/Luxapodular/processing.py) by [Luca Damasco](https://github.com/Luxapodular), mentored by [Golan Levin](https://github.com/golanlevin)

Prior to the start of the Google Summer of Code, Processing’s Python mode would not work at all with Processing 3.0 do to some extensive back end changes. Fortunately, this summer saw the revitalization and updating of Python Mode! Users may now write Processing 3.0 Sketches using Python syntax in the new editor. Due to a few outstanding bugs, it has not yet been officially released, but feel free to try it out by building the [Processing.py Source](https://github.com/Luxapodular/processing.py) on your own machine. In addition to once again making Python Mode functional, I have edited over 1000 lines of reference code as well as ported 9 new tutorials!
